\title{wfgTransformation - used by wfgEval to apply a transformation to part of the search-space vector}
\usage{
wfgTransformation(M, current, t_, start.index, apply.length, n, k, params)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{\cr
The number of objectives}

\item{current}{\cr
The current transformation function specified by the user}

\item{start.index}{}

\item{apply.length}{\cr
Specifying to which entries to apply the transformation to.}

\item{n}{\cr
The search-space dimension.}

\item{k}{\cr
The number of position-dependent parameters.}

\item{params}{\cr
List of parameters to this shape}
}
\value{
The vector x to which the shape has been applied. Those entries that were changed now have their final objective value, but more shapes can follow for the later indices.
