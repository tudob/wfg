Package: wfg
Title: WFG toolkit implementation package
Description: The toolkit presented by the WFG group in 2006 provides a way to
    define test problems for multi-criterion optimization. Their implementation
    relies on programming each test function in C++. This R package presents a
    way by which transformations, shapes and various parameters can be combined
    declaratively.
