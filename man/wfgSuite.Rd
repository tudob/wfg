\description{
Some of the example problems given by the WFG 2006 paper. \cr\cr
Implementation note: This is a deferred initialization which brings the definitions into the global environment. \cr\cr
They are wfgXspec, wfgX, wfgXt where X is 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9. \cr\cr
wfgXSpec is only the declarative specification,  \cr
wfgX is the actual evaluating function, \cr
wfgXt is its true-front version. \cr

\examples{
wfgSuite()
wfg1(rep(0.1, 5))
